# Car-Park-Free-Parking-Spaces-Detection
This project focuses on detecting free parking spaces in a car park using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective is to analyze video frames of a car park and determine which parking spaces are free and which are occupied. The system uses computer vision techniques to evaluate the occupancy status of each parking space.

## Libraries Used
OpenCV (cv2): Used for video processing and computer vision tasks.
Pickle: Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects, particularly for saving and loading parking space coordinates.
cvzone: Provides additional utilities and functions for OpenCV.
NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and array manipulations.

## Project Structure
  1. park_spaces.py
This script allows users to mark each parking space in the car park using a mouse click. These coordinates are then saved using the Pickle library for later use.

  2. main.py
The main script imports the file containing parking space coordinates generated by park_spaces.py. It processes the original video frames, identifies free and occupied parking spaces using pixel evaluation techniques, and displays the results.
